        "This week, we will be doing something slightly different. To supplement our Landsat observational data, we will be downloading a time-series of monthly climate data. The climate dataset we will be using is ERA5: the fifth generation atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). This is a _reanalysis_ dataset, combining contemporaneous observations and numerical modelling to provide a historical set of 'maps without gaps' from January 1940 to present. If you haven't encountered reanalysis data before, I would recommend reading the following short websites (including a short video!) to get a handle on things:\n",

        "\n",
        "It is worth keeping in mind the pros and cons of using reanalysis data. It is useful as it can provide a known dataset over any region of interest you like, even where observational data is poor. However, the further you get from observational data, the more your are relying on model accuracy. Global reanalyses are often run on the scale of tens of kilometres, meaning that it will not properly account for local topography and other fine-scale aspects of weather and climate. Generally, finding local observational data or high-resolution model runs might be prefereable for local studies; however, this approach will work for now as it will provide a consistent baseline dataset for our projects. If you can easily find local data for your project though, all the better!\n",

        "We will be using the [ERA5-Land](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/era5-land) monthly aggregated dataset, which has a spatial resolution of 9 km.
