You can start by setting these to -1 and +1, but if your NDI values are particularly clustered around zero, you could try compressing this to e.g. -0.4 and 0.4. Make sure the absolute negative and positive values are the same, so that is is centred on zero.\n",

        "The second is the colour scale. Have an explore of these to your heart's content - there are more avaible under the `More color scales` option. As we are displaying a diverging colour scale (centred on zero), it makes sense to choose a diverging colour bar (e.g. red-blue, purple-green, with a white/grey/etc middle). Try and pick one that is (i) colour-blind friendly (no red-green!) and (ii) communicates something about the NDI value you are showing. As we are currently looking at ice, a red-blue colour scale makes sense, with blue denoting ice. brown-green is commonly used in NDVI studies. Note the `Invert Color Ramp` option in the drop-down menu, which can be used to make blue-red into red-blue if so desired (and vice versa)."
