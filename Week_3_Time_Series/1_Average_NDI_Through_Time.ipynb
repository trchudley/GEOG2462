The first is to filter by the `CLOUD_COVER` metadata only to images that have less then 70% cloud cover within an image. The second, which is slightly more complex, uses the `.map()` function. This is a new feature that will allow us to apply a processing routine to every individual image within the image collection. the `lambda image:` tells Python \"_as you go through the image collection, we will pretend that every individual image has the variable name_ `image`_. Then, perform the calculation to the right of the colon to every_ `image`_._\"\n",

Later in the notebook, we will be calculating the median NDVI value within the sample region - masking the cloudy pixels ensures we aren't also including the NDVI of cloudy regions within the median value.

We then use the `.median()` function to produce a single composite image that is constructed as the median value from every image in the month.
