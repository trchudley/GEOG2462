    "\n",
    " - It's an employable skill. QGIS is open-source (free to access). As a result, smaller firms, NGOs, and government departments often uses QGIS instead of Arc for cost reasons.\n",
    " - QGIS is available for MacOS and Linux operating systems as well as Microsoft Windows, so it is more accessible. You will be able to [download the software for free](https://qgis.org/) on your own laptop regardless of your setup, allowing you to perform this practical (and any future work!) outside of the University system and on your own hardware.\n",
    " - It is easier to access more advanced open-source methods (e.g. AI). You will do this in QGIS if you take Patrice Carbonneau's Remote Sensing course (GEOG3261) next year!\n",
    " - Understanding how to perform operations within both ArcGIS and QGIS will help you to understand the _general_ principles of GIS software, rather than just knowing what buttons to press to get a result!\r\n",
    "> ⚠️ __Note__: Within this course, you are not being marked on your ability to use QGIS. This notebook simply instructs you how to open, visualise, and map data within QGIS - as it will be necessary to present maps of your data within the project report. If, based on the course to date or your own experience, you are more comfortable using ArcGIS to create maps, then that's absolutely fine!\n",

    "You may note that our data is not being visualised as a perfect square - it is slightly 'rotated'. This is to do with our projection system (recall this from last year). We defined our AOI using latitude and longitude: within the projection world, this system has the [EPSG code 4326](https://epsg.io/4326). However, this is not a sensible system with which to store satellite imagery. [Landsat data uses the Universal Transverse Mercator grid system](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-does-term-utm-mean-utm-better-or-more-accurate-latitudelongitude). The relevant UTM zone for Durham (and the UK, much of Spain, etc) is UTM 30N ([EPSG code 32630](https://epsg.io/32630)). You can see what UTM grid we're working in by looking at the bottom right corner of the QGIS window. So this is why our AOI looks rotated: we've requested a 'square' of data in lat/lon that doesn't look like a square in UTM coordinates. QGIS is great at reprojecting data on-the-fly to all appear in the same projection, which is very convenient. However, actual operations (clipping, masking, etc.) still requires data to be in the same projection - so if you're ever having issues, this is one of the first things to sanity check!"

You can see that QGIS has automatically assigned the red, green, and blue channels to the first three bands, and discussed above. You can also see it has set minimum and maximum values, likely somewhere between 0 and 1.0. These values are assigned based on the minimum and maximum values within each band (look into the `Min / Max Value Settings` drop-down option), but you can also set them manually if there's something wrong - e.g. if the image looks too 'bright' or oversaturated, you can always increase the maximum manually, or vice versa.\n",
