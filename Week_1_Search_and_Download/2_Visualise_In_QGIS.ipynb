        "You may note that our data is not being visualised as a perfect square - it is slightly 'rotated'. This is to do with our projection system (recall this from last year). We defined our AOI using latitude and longitude: within the projection world, this system has the [EPSG code 4326](https://epsg.io/4326). However, this is not a sensible system with which to store satellite imagery. [Landsat data uses the Universal Transverse Mercator grid system](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-does-term-utm-mean-utm-better-or-more-accurate-latitudelongitude). The relevant UTM zone for Durham (and the UK, much of Spain, etc) is UTM 30N ([EPSG code 32630](https://epsg.io/32630)). You can see what UTM grid we're working in by looking at the bottom right corner of the QGIS window. So this is why our AOI looks rotated: we've requested a 'square' of data in lat/lon that doesn't look like a square in UTM coordinates. QGIS is great at reprojecting data on-the-fly to all appear in the same projection, which is very convenient. However, actual operations (clipping, masking, etc.) still requires data to be in the same projection - so if you're ever having issues, this is one of the first things to sanity check!"

These values are assigned based on the minimum and maximum values within each band (look into the `Min / Max Value Settings` drop-down option), but you can also set them manually if there's something wrong - e.g. if the image looks too 'bright' or oversaturated, you can always increase the maximum manually, or vice versa."
