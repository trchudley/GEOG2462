## GEOG2462 Project 2C: Remote Sensing of Surface Change

**GEOG2462 Scientific Research in Geography** \

**Department of Geography, Durham University 2023/24**

Practical exercises, code, and instructions associated with GEOG2462 Project 2C at Durham University. 

Each sub-directory contained the material for a different week of the module. Open up the `.ipynb` files, which are Jupyter Notebooks. Where these Notebooks include code that can run, there will be an **Open in Colab** link at the top of the file. Click these to open them from within Google Colaboratory, where you can run the code.

Work through the documents in order at your own pace. Satellite raster data will be exported to your Google Drive - we will download these to our local drive and visualise them in QGIS.
