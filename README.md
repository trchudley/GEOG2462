Practical exercises, code, and instructions associated with GEOG2462 Project 2C at Durham University. 

Each sub-directory contains the material for a different week of the module. Open up the `.ipynb` files, which are Jupyter Notebooks. Where these Notebooks include code that can run, there will be an **Open in Colab** link at the top of the file. Click these to open them from within Google Colaboratory, where you can run the code. Additionally, stripped-down version of the Notebooks (without the explanatory text) are available in the [Short Scripts folder on Github](https://github.com/trchudley/GEOG2462/tree/main/Short_Scripts), allowing you to accelerate your data production.

Work through the documents in order at your own pace. Satellite raster data will be exported to your Google Drive - we will download these to our local drive and visualise them in QGIS.
